-->Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

if one machine fails or not available and we deployed the appication how to over come?
 other machines will spread accross handle and run and deploy(mainanancey and operational is tedeus in case of manual).

3types of networks in docker
bridge,host,none
in case of bridge network we can connect only one machine.

docker provides Overly network
it communicate accross many machines

bridge network is used only single machine or host machine it provide ip information and machine information.
it provides orchestration  it make available to end user

-->In Kubernetes, orchestration means automatically managing containers
-->It’s used to describe settings, configurations, or instructions in many tools, especially in Kubernetes, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.

Detects when a machine (node) fails

Moves the containers (apps) to other healthy machines

Keeps your app running smoothly4

termonologies 
POD-->is smallest unit .it manage the container.1 or more container.
Node -->machine (physical or virtual) in a kubernates clusterthat run your application.
 Each Node contains the tools needed to run Pods

Cluster
A Kubernetes cluster is a group of computers (called nodes) that work together to run your containerized applications. These nodes can be real machines or virtual ones.

Deployment
Kubernetes object used to manage a set of Pods running your containerized applications.

Secret
A Secret is a way to store sensitive information (like passwords, API keys, or tokens) securely in a Kubernetes cluster.

Persistent Volume (PV)
A Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes is a piece of storage in the cluster that you can use to store data and it doesn’t get deleted when a Pod is removed or restarted.Amazon EBS volumes
Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).
